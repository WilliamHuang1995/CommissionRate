# CommissionRate
A small program that I wrote to help ease up some time for my mother
  
# Program Logic
1. Display a GUI interface for user to select input file and output folder
2. Another program parses the input file and outputs the result into the output folder. It automatically names it "Output.xls"

# Note
I did not include the Apache Poi Library since I was having trouble uploading it. Perhaps licensing issue or maybe the library is a bit too big for git to add.
